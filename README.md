# Disaster_tweets

This project uses an introductory dataset from Kaggle.com about sentiment analysis of Tweets.
The tweets are split into two categories, either "Disaster" or "Not Disaster".
And the goal is to train an unsupervised learning algorithm to classify tweets based on text into either category.

The goals
* To perform sucessful data cleanup to provide the best overall model performance possible.
* To train a model to predict whether a tweet falls into category 1 or 0 based on the contents of the text column in either data set.
